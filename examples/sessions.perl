# This is the first test program written for POE.  It originally was
# written to test POE's ability to dispatch events to inline sessions
# (which was the only kind of sessions at the time).  It was later
# amended to test directly calling event handlers, delayed garbage
# collection, and some other things that new developers probably don't
# need to know. :)

# use POE always includes POE::Kernel and POE::Session, since they are
# the fundamental POE classes and universally used.  POE::Kernel
# exports the $kernel global, a reference to the process' Kernel
# instance.  POE::Session exports a number of constants for event
# handler parameter offsets.  Some of the offsets are KERNEL, HEAP,
# SESSION, and ARG0-ARG9.
