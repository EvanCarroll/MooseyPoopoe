# This is an early, basic test of POE's filehandle selecting
# mechanism.  It was written before POE::Wheel classes were conceived.
# In fact, Wheels were invented after realizing that this program's
# 'accept', 'read' and 'write' states would probably need to be
# replicated for every TCP server that came after this one.

# Anyway, this program creates two sessions.  The first is an average
# TCP chargen server, and the second is an average line-based client.
# The client connects to the server, displays a few lines of chargen
# output, and closes.  The server remains active, and it can be
# connected to by other clients, such as netcat or telnet.

# This is a pre-wheel sockets test.  It's one of the few that uses
# IO::Socket.  All the others (with exception of wheels.perl) have
# been adapted to use POE::Wheel::SocketFactory.

# If some aspects of using sessions are confusing, please see the
# *session*.perl tests.  They are commented in more detail.
