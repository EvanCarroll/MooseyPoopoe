  2009-03-07 19:08:57 (r2496) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE.pm M

    Another development release. This one relies on the latest
    POE::Test::Loops changes.

  2009-03-07 19:07:45 (r2495) by rcaputo; poe/mylib/PoeBuildInfo.pm M

    We need POE::Test::Loops 1.004 or later now. 

  2009-03-06 06:44:04 (r2492) by rcaputo
  poe/t/90_regression/rt39872-sigchld-stop.t A; poe/MANIFEST M

  2009-03-02 20:52:40 (r2490) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Filter.pm M

    Gcola discovered that we don't explain POE::Filter get() and
    get_one() return values when there's nothing to return. 

  2009-03-02 20:19:54 (r2489) by bingosnet; poe/lib/POE/Session.pm M

    Fixed typo in =head1 EVENTS; 

  2009-03-02 20:17:53 (r2488) by bingosnet

    Restrict what Fcntl exports. Bump up the versions for a new test
    release.

  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Curses.pm M; poe/lib/POE/Pipe.pm M;
  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/SocketFactory.pm M;
  poe/lib/POE/Resource/FileHandles.pm M

  poe/lib/POE/Resource/FileHandles.pm M

    tweaked the F_GETFL detection routine to be more portable, thanks
    dngor/p5p for the help!

    Move around some POSIX constants so they're used where they're
    needed. 

  2009-02-28 18:15:48 (r2473) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE.pm M

    Another developer release for 5.6.2 testing.

  2009-02-28 17:36:13 (r2472) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Resource/FileHandles.pm M

    Add even more fcntl() diagnostic information for a failure the cpan
    testers are seeing on 5.6.2.

  poe/t/90_regression/rt39872-sigchld.t A;
  poe/lib/POE/Resource/Signals.pm M; poe/lib/POE/Loop/PerlSignals.pm M;
  poe/MANIFEST M

    Apply Philip Gwyn's testcase and patch for an end-time hang when
    USE_SIGCHLD is enabled, POE::Kernel is idle, but there are one or
    more outstanding child processes waiting to be reaped. The hang was
    caused by clearing $SIG{CHLD}, which would never allow POE::Kernel's
    "we have child processes" flags to be cleared. Resolves rt.cpan.org
    #39872. 

  2009-02-25 07:58:55 (r2466) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE.pm M

    New test release.

  2009-02-25 07:57:54 (r2465) by rcaputo
  poe/t/10_units/01_pod/02_pod_coverage.t M

    Avoid a lot of warnings, which are the inevitable result of loading
    all POE modules, even the ones which are alternate implementations of
    the same methods.

  2009-02-25 07:48:14 (r2464) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Resource/FileHandles.pm M

    Improve fcntl() error messages to help track down a 5.6.2 failure. 

  2009-02-22 19:48:13 (r2461) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE.pm M

    Time for a developer release, to test all the changes that have
    accumulated so far.

  2009-02-22 18:51:40 (r2457) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Try to clarify the _trap() message so that people look above the trap
    for problems within their own programs. 

  2009-02-22 18:44:15 (r2456) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/NFA.pm M

    Reformat some contributed code. 

  2009-02-22 07:45:28 (r2455) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Resource/FileHandles.pm M

    Bypass errors when trying to ignore filehandles whose fileno() are
    not defined.

  2009-02-18 10:02:54 (r2454) by bingosnet
  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/ReadWrite.pm M

    Fixed some of the links in ReadWrite POD

  2009-02-17 08:03:49 (r2450) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm M;
  poe-test-loops/lib/POE/Test/Loops/wheel_readline.pm M

    Resolve rt.cpan.org #38974, reported by Jari Bonte. If TERM is
    misset, we will skip the POE::Wheel::ReadLine test rather than fail. 

  2009-02-17 07:28:32 (r2449) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Resource/Signals.pm M

    Resolve rt.cpan.org #37938, reported by Rob Bloodgood. 

  2009-02-17 06:42:00 (r2448) by apocal
  poe/t/00_info.t A; poe/MANIFEST M

    added placeholder test in root t/ directory to get around
    perl-5.6.2+Test::Harness failures

  poe/t/90_regression/rt19908-merlyn-stop.t M

    skip test because of broken alarm() on MSWin32 with perl5.6

  2009-02-16 10:58:16 (r2442) by apocal; poe/lib/POE/NFA.pm M

    added missing localized nowarnings so we skip 'used only once' on
    TRACE_DESTROY

  2009-02-16 10:52:48 (r2441) by apocal; poe/MANIFEST M

    added missing nfa test to MANIFEST

    removed yet another warning :(

  2009-02-16 07:41:37 (r2436) by apocal
  poe/lib/POE/Resource/Statistics.pm M

  2009-02-16 06:51:08 (r2434) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm M

  2009-02-16 06:41:51 (r2433) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm M

    Finish the first redocumentation pass for

  2009-02-16 05:11:49 (r2432) by apocal

    Document through new()'s paramters. 

  2009-02-13 14:36:37 (r2430) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Filter/Line.pm M

    Note that POE::Filter::Line strips newlines from input. 

  2009-02-10 15:15:53 (r2429) by apocal
  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/FollowTail.pm M

    fix test failure with 90_regression/bingos-followtail.t on MSWin32
    
    This passes the test on my linux/win32 boxes under perl 5.8.8 and
    5.10.0 BUT WE NEED MORE TESTS, especially for the "Handle"
    parameter... 

  2009-02-10 10:22:20 (r2428) by apocal; poe/lib/POE/Loop/TkCommon.pm M

    fix Tk warning ( argument idle isn't numeric in multiplication )

    Fix a plethora of warnings that were uncovered by lexically scoping

  2009-02-10 07:12:04 (r2425) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm M

    Redocument some more, and put in an =over to quiet POD tests for the
    time being. 

  2009-02-10 06:36:41 (r2424) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Session.pm M

    POE::Session would clear $^W unconditionally, which we consider to be
    bad. Localized $^W=0 to only affect the current block of code. Thanks
    to Tod McQuillin on IRC for spotting the problem.

  2009-02-09 16:20:10 (r2418) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Resource/Statistics.pm M

    Fix tab damage. No significant changes occurred here. 

  2009-02-09 07:52:06 (r2417) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm M

    Do a bit more rewriting. 

  2009-02-03 07:53:57 (r2416) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm M

    Document another chunk of POE::Component::Server::TCP, and deprecate
    Args in favor of ClientArgs. 

  2009-02-03 07:48:59 (r2415) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Loop/Event.pm M

    Skip POE::Wheel::ReadLine tests when using Event on darwin. Event
    fails with an "Event: '?? Event.pm:109' was unexpectedly closed"
    error. Event skips a couple of its own tests in t/io.t for the same
    reason, so this seems to be an Event-on-darwin issue. A better
    workaround (or fix) is welcome. I'm sure Event's owner wouldn't mind
    one also. 

  2009-02-02 07:58:33 (r2414) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm M

    Rewrote another chunk of documentation.

  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm M; poe/lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm M

    Begin rewriting POE::Component::Server::TCP's documentation. Made a
    couple tweaks to POE::Wheel::Run's as well (since the "Redocument"
    TODO was mistakenly left in there). 

  2009-01-27 08:21:31 (r2410) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Resource/Statistics.pm M

    method.

  2008-12-14 08:47:08 (r2406) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm M

    Finish first draft rewrite of documentation.

    Let's try this again.

  poe/mylib/Makefile-5004.pm M; poe/mylib/Makefile-5005.pm M

    Touch mylib/gen-tests.perl during Makefile.PL execution. This
    triggers gen-tests.perl during "make test".

  poe/mylib/Makefile-5004.pm M; poe/mylib/Makefile-5005.pm M

    Move test generation to PL_FILES. Requires a separate "make" for the
    tests to be generated. 

  2008-07-05 20:15:25 (r2389) by rcaputo; poe/mylib/gen-meta.perl M

    Add build_requires and rename config_requires to configure_requires.

    Add POE::Test::Loops to config_requires, so modern systems can
    install it before Makefile.PL runs. Allow gen-tests.pl to fail
    gracefully if POE::Test::Loops isn't installed. Remove a bunch of
    tabs from unrelated files.

    Link the sig_child() documentation to the USE_SIGCHLD documentation
    per Marc Lehmann's feedback. 

  2008-04-28 06:16:20 (r2319) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Per Marc Lehmann's feedback, I have documented how to avoid a
    potential race condition when catching child processes with
    sig_child(). Basically, if you want sig_child() to catch a process,
    call the method in the same event handler that forked the process.
    Otherwise POE::Kernel may reap the process before sig_child() is
    called. 

  2008-04-26 09:13:50 (r2318) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Document how to avoid the run-wasn't-called warning. Thanks to Marc
    Lehmann for reminding me to document it. 

  2008-04-20 21:10:54 (r2317) by rcaputo

    Resolve rt.cpan.org ticket 34803. Apocalypse pointed out that

    Removal of POE::API::ResLoader broke POE::API::Peek. This change
    re-initializes $poe_kernel members that stopped being set by the

  2008-03-27 18:17:26 (r2303) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    LARGE_QUEUE_SIZE isn't needed anymore. Linear scanning wasn't that
    much of an optimization.
