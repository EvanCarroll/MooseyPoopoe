    Time for a new release.

  2009-04-21 04:01:03 (r2524) by rcaputo; poe/mylib/PoeBuildInfo.pm M

    Skip the IO::Tty dependency on MSWin32. Windows doesn't have
    pseudo-ttys. Resolves bugs reported by Chris Williams, Adam Kennedy,
    Offer Kaye (rt.cpan.org #44931), and many more. 

  2009-04-15 22:32:14 (r2523) by bingosnet; poe/lib/POE/Session.pm M

    Clean up some large loose ends in the POD.

  2009-03-27 20:38:41 (r2511) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE.pm M

    New dev release to address issues with Andreas Koenig's smoker. He's
    setting a DISPLAY that cannot be reached.

  2009-03-27 20:17:27 (r2510) by rcaputo; poe/mylib/PoeBuildInfo.pm M

    Avoid IO::Pty crashes on fbsd 6.4 with perl 5.8.8.

  2009-03-27 20:02:21 (r2509) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Loop/Gtk.pm M

    Skip Gtk tests if Gtk cannot be initialized.

  2009-03-27 17:35:31 (r2508) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Loop/Tk.pm M

    Skip Tk tests if Tk cannot be started.

  2009-03-27 16:28:34 (r2507) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE.pm M; poe/MANIFEST M

    Remove a new test that segfaults for some people, and bump the
    version for another (hopefully final) dev release.

  2009-03-14 20:43:28 (r2506) by bingosnet; poe/lib/POE/NFA.pm M

  2009-03-07 19:08:57 (r2496) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE.pm M

    Another development release. This one relies on the latest
    POE::Test::Loops changes.

  2009-03-07 19:07:45 (r2495) by rcaputo; poe/mylib/PoeBuildInfo.pm M

    We need POE::Test::Loops 1.004 or later now. 

  2009-03-06 06:44:04 (r2492) by rcaputo
  poe/t/90_regression/rt39872-sigchld-stop.t A; poe/MANIFEST M

    Add Philip Gwyn's test for a failure for POE::Kernel to stop if
    lingering processes are around without a sig_child() to reap them. 

  2009-03-02 20:52:40 (r2490) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Filter.pm M

    Gcola discovered that we don't explain POE::Filter get() and
    get_one() return values when there's nothing to return. 

  2009-03-02 20:19:54 (r2489) by bingosnet; poe/lib/POE/Session.pm M

    Fixed typo in =head1 EVENTS; 

  2009-03-02 20:17:53 (r2488) by bingosnet

  2009-03-01 20:06:23 (r2479) by apocal
  poe/lib/POE/Resource/FileHandles.pm M

    tweaked the F_GETFL detection routine to be more portable, thanks

    needed. 

  2009-02-28 18:15:48 (r2473) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE.pm M

    Another developer release for 5.6.2 testing.

  2009-02-28 17:36:13 (r2472) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Resource/FileHandles.pm M

    Add even more fcntl() diagnostic information for a failure the cpan
    testers are seeing on 5.6.2.

  poe/lib/POE/Resource/Signals.pm M; poe/lib/POE/Loop/PerlSignals.pm M;
  poe/MANIFEST M

    Apply Philip Gwyn's testcase and patch for an end-time hang when
    USE_SIGCHLD is enabled, POE::Kernel is idle, but there are one or
    more outstanding child processes waiting to be reaped. The hang was
    caused by clearing $SIG{CHLD}, which would never allow POE::Kernel's
    "we have child processes" flags to be cleared. Resolves rt.cpan.org
    #39872. 

  2009-02-25 07:58:55 (r2466) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE.pm M

    New test release.

  2009-02-25 07:57:54 (r2465) by rcaputo
  poe/t/10_units/01_pod/02_pod_coverage.t M

    Avoid a lot of warnings, which are the inevitable result of loading
    all POE modules, even the ones which are alternate implementations of
    the same methods.

  2009-02-25 07:48:14 (r2464) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Resource/FileHandles.pm M

    Improve fcntl() error messages to help track down a 5.6.2 failure. 

  2009-02-22 19:48:13 (r2461) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE.pm M

    Time for a developer release, to test all the changes that have
    accumulated so far.

  2009-02-22 18:51:40 (r2457) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Try to clarify the _trap() message so that people look above the trap
    for problems within their own programs. 

  2009-02-22 18:44:15 (r2456) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/NFA.pm M

    Reformat some contributed code. 

  2009-02-22 07:45:28 (r2455) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Resource/FileHandles.pm M

    Bypass errors when trying to ignore filehandles whose fileno() are
    not defined.

  2009-02-18 10:02:54 (r2454) by bingosnet
  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/ReadWrite.pm M

    Fixed some of the links in ReadWrite POD

  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm M;
  poe-test-loops/lib/POE/Test/Loops/wheel_readline.pm M

    Resolve rt.cpan.org #38974, reported by Jari Bonte. If TERM is
    misset, we will skip the POE::Wheel::ReadLine test rather than fail. 

  2009-02-17 07:28:32 (r2449) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Resource/Signals.pm M

    Resolve rt.cpan.org #37938, reported by Rob Bloodgood.

  2009-02-16 10:52:48 (r2441) by apocal; poe/MANIFEST M

  2009-02-16 05:11:49 (r2432) by apocal

  2009-02-10 15:15:53 (r2429) by apocal
  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/FollowTail.pm M

    fix test failure with 90_regression/bingos-followtail.t on MSWin32
    
    This passes the test on my linux/win32 boxes under perl 5.8.8 and
    5.10.0 BUT WE NEED MORE TESTS, especially for the "Handle"

  2009-02-10 10:22:20 (r2428) by apocal; poe/lib/POE/Loop/TkCommon.pm M

  2009-02-10 07:12:04 (r2425) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm M

    Redocument some more, and put in an =over to quiet POD tests for the
    time being. 

  2009-02-10 06:36:41 (r2424) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Session.pm M

    POE::Session would clear $^W unconditionally, which we consider to be
    bad. Localized $^W=0 to only affect the current block of code. Thanks

    Do a bit more rewriting. 

  2009-02-03 07:53:57 (r2416) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm M

    Document another chunk of POE::Component::Server::TCP, and deprecate
    Args in favor of ClientArgs. 

  2009-02-03 07:48:59 (r2415) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Loop/Event.pm M

    Skip POE::Wheel::ReadLine tests when using Event on darwin. Event
    fails with an "Event: '?? Event.pm:109' was unexpectedly closed"
    error. Event skips a couple of its own tests in t/io.t for the same
    reason, so this seems to be an Event-on-darwin issue. A better
    workaround (or fix) is welcome. I'm sure Event's owner wouldn't mind
    one also. 

  2009-02-02 07:58:33 (r2414) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm M

    Rewrote another chunk of documentation.

  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm M; poe/lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm M

    Begin rewriting POE::Component::Server::TCP's documentation. Made a
    couple tweaks to POE::Wheel::Run's as well (since the "Redocument"
    TODO was mistakenly left in there). 

  2009-01-27 08:21:31 (r2410) by rcaputo

  poe/mylib/Makefile-5004.pm M; poe/mylib/Makefile-5005.pm M

    Touch mylib/gen-tests.perl during Makefile.PL execution. This

    Add POE::Test::Loops to config_requires, so modern systems can
    install it before Makefile.PL runs. Allow gen-tests.pl to fail
    gracefully if POE::Test::Loops isn't installed. Remove a bunch of

  2008-04-28 06:16:20 (r2319) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Per Marc Lehmann's feedback, I have documented how to avoid a
    potential race condition when catching child processes with
    sig_child(). Basically, if you want sig_child() to catch a process,
    call the method in the same event handler that forked the process.
    Otherwise POE::Kernel may reap the process before sig_child() is
    called. 

  2008-04-26 09:13:50 (r2318) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Document how to avoid the run-wasn't-called warning. Thanks to Marc
    Lehmann for reminding me to document it. 

  2008-04-20 21:10:54 (r2317) by rcaputo
  poe/t/30_loops/00_base/wheel_run.pm M

    Increase the timeout in a test to avoid false errors.
